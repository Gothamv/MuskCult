Steps I did after cloning and pushing changes to the repo following the tutorial:

1. Clone the repository:
$ git clone git@github.com:Gothamv/MuskCult.git

2. See if folder is correctly clone:
$ ls

3. Change directory to the cloned folder
$ cd MuskCult/

4. See hidden and all files in the folder:
$ ls -a

5. Initialize a file under the Git Repository:
$ touch TestPushRepo.txt

6. Initiates an empty git repository:
$ git init

7. Add the new created file to Staging Area to commit:
$ git add TestPushRepo.txt

8. See file is staged
$ git status

9. Check for which branch I'm at:
$ git branch

10. Create a new branch (if neccessary):
$ git checkout -b <new_branch_name>

11. Switch between branches (if neccessary):
$ git checkout <branch_name>

12. Check for new changes have been made but not yet staged or committed (optional):
& git diff

13. If new changes is made in file, add file to repo, then commit (optional when new changes is made)

14. Commit changes made to the Git Repo:
$ git commit -m "Testing"

15. View commit history:
$ git log --oneline OR $ git log

16. Create a PR (aka. pull request). Since I don't have direct access to repo, then I have to create a fork to create a PR:
Source: 
https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork
    a. Create a new fork
    b. At my fork, get the SSH remote repo URL
    c. Add the remote repo, with command OR Set the remote repo:
    $ git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>
    OR
    $ git remote set-url <remote_repository_URL>

17. Check for the remote repo:
$ git remote -v

18. Push changes
$ git push -u origin <my_branch_name>

19. Reload the "pull requests" page

20. "To create a pull request that is ready for review, click Create Pull Request"

21. Once the PR is accepted, then I can pull it to the main/master branch
